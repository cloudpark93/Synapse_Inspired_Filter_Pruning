# Synapse_Inspired_Filter_Pruning
In the human synaptic system, there are two important channels known as excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters that transmit a signal from a neuron to a cell. Adopting the neuroscientific perspective, we propose a synapse-inspired filter pruning method.

* This is much advanced than my other repository, [easy-filter-pruning](https://github.com/cloudpark93/easy-filter-pruning).

# Main Concept of Synapse Inspired Filter Pruning

In the synaptic transmission system of a biological neural network, the basis of an artificial neural network, there coexists excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. The excitatory neurotransmitter enhances or increases the activation in the postsynaptic membrane, while the inhibitory neurotransmitter decreases or prevents the activation. Similarly, filters of CNN models are composed of positive weights and negative weights. Considering the neuroscientific perspective, we propose a new filter pruning approach that separately analyzes the positive and negative weights in the filters.
